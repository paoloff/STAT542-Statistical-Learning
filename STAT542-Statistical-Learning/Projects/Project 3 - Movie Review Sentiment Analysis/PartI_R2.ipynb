    "\n",
    "-  Sentiment analysis is a tool for classifying people's impression of a product or topic.\n",
    "-  Using sentiment analysis, an algorithm can read a text written in natural language and map it to a scale ranging from positive to negative feelings.\n",
    "-  Because it is able to interpret human language, sentiment analysis is widely used in many online platforms.\n",
    "-  For instance, companies use sentiment analysis to gain direct feedback of customers of a product."

    "\n",
    "- In this project, we create a sentiment analysis model to interpret movie reviews in the IMDB website.\n",
    "- The data consists of 50000 reviews which have scores from 0 to 10.\n",
    "- If the score is below or equal to 4, it is classified as negative. If the score is 7 or bigger, it is classified as positive (the reviews with scores of 5 and 6 are excluded from this analysis).\n",
    "- The goal of the algorithm is to guess if the review is negative or positive directly from the text written by the reviewer."
